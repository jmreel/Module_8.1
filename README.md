# Project Overview
Amazing Prime video is a streaming platform and would like to create an algorithm to predict which low budget films will become popular. To answer this question Amazing Prime Video is sponsoring a hackathon and provide a clean set of data. In order to accomplish this, they will use data from Wikipedia, Kaggle and ratings data from the Movie Lens website. The data from the three sources will be extracted, transformed, and loaded into a SQL table.
